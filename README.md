This project was create with create-react-app with eject so we can play with webpack adding the `babel-plugin-transform-class-properties` for static properties in a class and `babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy` to add decorators to a class.

At the moment this is just a demo on one source drag item to multiple sources drop targets.
